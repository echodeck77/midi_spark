# MidiSpark — PENDING TASKS (forward checklist)

_The canonical "what's left" list. CLAUDE.md's "Current status" is the backward log (what LANDED, with commit
refs); THIS file is forward-looking (what's open). Keep them from overlapping: when a task lands, tick it here
AND add its commit line to CLAUDE.md status. Terse by design — detail lives in the spec (`midispark-spec-v3.0-
delta.md`, esp. §10) and the `Docs/design-*.md` ferries. Last synced: 2026-08-18._

## ★ THE REEL-TO-REEL — STEP 1 LANDED (Paul 2026-08-18)
The 1-pass output-tape (RECORD → REPLACE live output, LOOP; second touch resumes). Built at the Kernel seam: `ReelDeck`
+ `ReelTap` (Foundation-only, in Emission.swift, unit-tested); the tap records every emitted event with its pass-relative
beat; on ARM the just-finished pass becomes the loop and REPLACES live from the next pass boundary; a second touch
resumes live. Flushes on the transitions (allNotesOff entering replay · CC120/123 leaving) → no stuck notes. Reel-to-reel
glyph bottom-left of the BUILD page (amber armed · green replaying). Rulings applied: REPLACE the output · loop 1 pass ·
second touch resumes. macOS 762 green (4 ReelDeck tests), iOS builds. **DEVICE EAR OWED** (render path — unheard here).
- [x] **STEP 2 — EXPORT LANDED (Paul 2026-08-18)**: LONG-PRESS the reel glyph → the recorded pass exported as SMF files
  (`MidiFile.swift`, pure + unit-tested): `MidiSpark-All.mid` = the A–D SUM (each emitter on its stamp channel, cable-0
  All duplicates dropped) + a per-emitter stem (`-A/-B/-C/-D`) for each cable that has events. Files written to the temp
  dir + presented in a share sheet (`ReelShareSheet`). The deck now keeps the last COMPLETED pass every boundary (not
  only on arm), so export works after any pass. macOS 766 green (+4 MidiFileTests). **DEVICE test owed** (the share
  sheet from an AUv3 extension is the risk).
  - Delivery = SHARE SHEET, chosen (Paul 2026-08-18, "simple version for now"). The robust App Group + Files-sharing
    route (extension → shared container → container app copies to its Files-visible Documents via
    UIFileSharingEnabled / LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace) is DEFERRED — revisit if the share sheet won't present in
    a host, or once the standalone app lands.
- [x] **STEP 3 — THE PASS BROWSER pop-up LANDED (Paul 2026-08-19)**: the reel glyph now TAPS OPEN an 8×8 pop-up. TOP 4
  rows = the last 32 passes (`ReelDeck` gained a 32-slot history RING: flat `hist` buffer, `passNumbers()` oldest→newest
  so the newest lands bottom-right, `selectPass`/`selectedPassNo` pin, `selectedRoll()` note-pairing); each populated cell
  shows its 1-based pass number, tap = SELECT + REPLAY NOW (replace live output), tapping the replaying one stops → live.
  BOTTOM 4 rows = the selected pass drawn as A/B/C/D piano-roll lanes (Canvas, pitch shared-scaled, x by pass length,
  opacity by velocity). SAVE = export the selected pass via the share sheet (STEP 2 path). Engine: `reelSelectRequest`/
  `reelStopRequest` consumed on the render thread (select → replaying + allNotesOff; stop → off + blanket-off + clear pin);
  ring fills continuously while live (recording was already always-on), promote pins-aware. macOS 771 green (+5 ReelDeck
  ring tests), iOS builds. **DEVICE EAR/EYE OWED.** Answers of record (Paul 2026-08-19): tap opens pop-up (retires
  tap-replay/long-press-export) · pass tap = select+play now · Save = selected pass → share.
  - v1 notes: bottom-right = the most-recent COMPLETED pass (the in-progress pass isn't replayable); ring per-pass cap
    8192 events (dense-pass overflow drops, as the record cap already does); selecting a pass while STOPPED pins it for
    SAVE but only sounds once the transport runs.
  - **FREEZE-WHILE-BROWSING (Paul 2026-08-19)**: the history tape stops writing whenever the browser is open OR a pass is
    replaying (`reelBrowsing` set by the pop-up's onAppear/onDisappear · `reelFrozen = reelBrowsing || replaying`), so the
    pass list is a stable snapshot; recording resumes on the NEXT FULL pass on exit (only a pass recorded start→finish,
    uninterrupted, is filed — `reelRecordFromStart`). Kernel-only (not unit-tested; device-verified path).
  - **ROLL PLAYHEAD (Paul 2026-08-19)**: while a pass replays, a white playhead sweeps the piano-roll lanes (TimelineView,
    beat-extrapolated one-clock) and each note LIGHTS (full hue + glow + thicker) as the head crosses it.
  - **ROLL GRID (Paul 2026-08-19)**: each lane now draws 8 CELL dividers + OCTAVE dividers (pitch framed to whole
    octaves) with the C labelled on BOTH the left + right axis, under the notes.
- v1 caveats to revisit: the pass boundary is detected at the render-block START (a few ms of slop); a brief gap on STOP
  (CC123 → the grid re-emits at the next column); the glyph is BUILD-page-only (could go global); doesn't yet snapshot
  tempo/scene changes mid-record.

## ★ SOON — PatternSpan (SPAN: CELL | ROW) rollout to the pattern processors (Paul 2026-08-18)
EUCLID SPAN landed (`e7e0043`, on `main`; commit line in CLAUDE.md status). `PatternSpan { cell, row }` + `euclidSpan`
are in place. ROW stretches a processor's N-step timeline across the whole 8-column BAR (a cross-column phrase) —
this is the arp/weave PHASE=FREE axis generalised, NOT note-sustain legato. The `iterateTicks` column gate already
scopes each cell to its own column, so per processor the work is small + uniform: engine = ONE line (the tick-grid
denominator `S` → `cycleBeats`), model = an additive-Optional field (nil ⇒ CELL, old docs safe), UI = a SPAN CELL|ROW
seg on the face, + a row-fills-a-row test (`testEuclidSpanRowSpreadsPulsesAcrossTheBar` is the template). Roll onto
(every processor rated ★★ or higher, in priority order):
- [ ] **LENGTH** ★★★ — the 8-slice gate spans the bar → a whole-bar trance-gate phrase. **Do first — biggest payoff.**
- [ ] **MOD** ★★★ — the LFO / STEPS period spans the bar. This IS the deferred CC-stage `SPAN CELL|PHRASE|FREE` sketch
  (`design-cc-stage-tactile-2026-08-09.md`) — reconcile the naming (PHRASE ≈ ROW) when building.
- [ ] **TUTTI (PATTERN)** ★★ — the 8-slice set-shape spans the bar.
- [ ] **RATCHET (PATTERN)** ★★ — the per-slice counts span the bar.
- [ ] **BURST** ★★ — the accel/decel roll unfolds across the whole bar.
- [ ] **CASCADE** ★★ — the note-reveal spans the bar (naturally musical over a phrase).
(CHANCE was ★ — deferred. ARP/WEAVE already have PHASE; DRONE/ECHO/GLIDE already flow across boundaries.)
**DEVICE ear owed on EUCLID ROW.**

## ★ DONE (2026-08-05/06) — MACROS (phase 2 track)
Specs: `AcceptanceCriteria-macro-panel.md` · `-macro-ab-authoring.md` · `-overlay-rule-macro-lanes.md`. `feat/macros`
MERGED to `main` 2026-08-05; the canonical MACRO AUTHORING FLOW landed 2026-08-06. Commit refs in CLAUDE.md status.
- [x] M0 state model · M1 offset term (base ⊕ Σ value×delta, folded at build; seals stable) + tests · M2 the 8
  slider macros as automatable AU params · M3 the MACROS tab panel (BTN|SLD|TML; sliders drive values + padlock) ·
  **M4 A/B authoring** (the [AB] popup on the Edit page's CHAIN header → live B demonstration → bind delta to a
  SLIDER macro; base restored to A on close). **MACROS ARE USABLE END-TO-END.**
- [x] BUTTON bank completed end-to-end (values via a direct document setter for 8–23; [AB] popup SLD|BTN selector).
- [x] OUTPUT group done end-to-end: the offset extended to the per-emitter role amounts (LEAK/DUCK/CURVE/POCKET,
  MacroEmitterTarget, folded in the builder) + the [AB] popup's CHAIN|OUTPUT selector + OUTPUT authoring.

## Open within macros (forward)
- [ ] INPUT group — the source shaping. **Underspecified**: the panel spec lists INPUT as a group but doesn't name
  its continuous targets. Candidates: the velocity window (floor/ceil) · the note range (lo/hi). Needs a pick before
  building (SnapCell-field fold + an INPUT group in the popup).
- [ ] TIMELINE bank (lane editor + per-column STEP|SMOOTH|BYPASS + the render-time per-column path, which replaces
  M1's bake-at-build for lanes) · BUTTON/TIMELINE binding + mover-eligibility live-dim · the A↔B morph-audition
  slider · the CC rail · the perform-surface panel in the GRID top band (part of the phase-2 GRID redesign) ·
  announce/ghost-thumb tells.

## ★ DONE (2026-08-05) — LAYOUT v2 tab shell (phase 1)
Spec of record: **`Docs/AcceptanceCriteria/layout-v2-tabs.md`**; plan `~/.claude/plans/resilient-imagining-truffle.md`.
On `main`, iOS builds, 428 green; commit refs in CLAUDE.md status; **device pass owed**.
- [x] Part 0 — retire SELECT · Parts 1-2 — six-tab bar + body switch (`AppTab`) · Part 3 — clock→header ·
  Part 4 — RECEIVERS tab (`ReceiverConfigView`) · Part 5 — EMITTERS tab (rack out of the grid).
- [ ] **Phase 2+ (deferred, captured):** GRID top-band 8 macro sliders+buttons · SINGLE|MULTI toggle · HOLD
  localisation per slider group · the MACROS + AUTOMATION engines/pages · global FREEZE/STUTTER gestures ·
  MIDI-OUT channels moved into the emitters tab. (These are engine/authoring work — needs Paul to prioritise.)

## ★ DONE (user, 2026-07-29) — /btw authoring UX + AcceptanceCriteria wave
Spec of record: **`Docs/AcceptanceCriteria/verbs-behaviour.md`**. All LANDED off-device (device pass owed) —
commit refs in CLAUDE.md "Current status":
- [x] **/btw ⑥** one-per-column per-hold · **④** retro-repaint · **⑤** per-cell + row selectors (already built) ·
  **STROKES** · **MIXED-SET law** · palette-live-during-holds (via ④).
- [x] **AcceptanceCriteria additions**: SELECT empty-tap no-op · **DELETE = SEVER** (children cut to MIDI-IN) ·
  **DESK RE-POINT** hard rule · **multi-cell routing (per-column)** + **SRC/DEST pulsing candidate look** ·
  placed/selected cells always WHITE · PLACE nearest-above nudge · **sticky routing** · **verbs do NOT latch**.
- [x] Refactor + tests: routing logic → pure `Derivations` helpers (`routeFociByColumn`, `placedCellRouting`) +
  `deleteCell` dedup (`181bf7c`).

## A. Blocked on the user (need a decision before building)
- [~] **Accent-colour dedup (refactor B1)** — MIGRATION IN PROGRESS. A `DesignKit.swift` token layer LANDED
  2026-08-16 (`enum UI`: cyan/amber/red/green/editHue/ink, values unchanged, migrated across ~10 files). BUT it's
  PARTIAL: the cyan literal still appears ~18×, amber ~16×, `editHue` is defined twice, and `FlowView.swift` still
  hardcodes a divergent receiver-hue array. **REMAINING OPEN DECISIONS:** `FlowView.swift`'s cyan is
  `Color(red:0.145,g:0.878,b:0.941)` — a real ~0.005 near-miss of the canonical `0.15/0.88/0.94`, still unruled
  (unify to canonical, or keep FlowView's tuned-for-dark-canvas value); and the same call on FlowView's divergent
  lighter receiver-hue array vs `receiverHues`.
- [ ] **midiNoteName convention** — the shared `midiNoteName` is 0-based (note 60 = "C5"); `RackMatrix.noteName` is
  `n/12−1` (note 60 = "C4"), so FENCE labels read an octave below the receiver RANGE labels. `midiNoteName`'s doc
  says it exists "so naming can't drift". Pick the canonical convention (C4=60 is the common MIDI one) → unify (a
  visible label shift, hence a ruling).
- [ ] **HOLD latch re-home** — §5c latch UI slot is vacant; CONTROLS-corner restoration recommended, awaiting the nod.
- [ ] **SCOPE ops home** — chips-during-SELECT-hold vs deferred (design device-nod).
- [x] **DELETE-sever fallback in the null era** (user ruled NULL, 2026-07-30) — severed children now fall to NULL
  input (inputRow nil AND inputReceiver nil, own emitters kept) instead of a phantom R1 re-point. Done in
  `deleteCellSever`; test updated. Reply to design-side owed (bundle with the file-read ack).

## B. ✅ DEVICE-VERIFIED (user device pass, 2026-07-30 — "happy with things as they stand")
The whole accumulated GUI + engine stack was run on device and ACCEPTED. Cleared from the owed list:
- [x] **Adoption ear-check** · **Strips** (session faces · LATCH · DUCK · SPACE-FILL · receiver marks · emitter buttons · verbs-as-pills) · **COPY·PASTE** · **preset enlarge + UNDO/REDO** · **white selected ring**.
- [x] **AcceptanceCriteria wave (2026-07-29)** — /btw ④⑥ · STROKES · MIXED-SET · DELETE-sever · multi-cell routing · candidate body-pulse · desk re-point.
- [x] **Routing view + visualisation (2026-07-30)** — IN/OUT labels · candidate-hides-content · the routing overlay (curved flows + comets · cell→cell arrow · band dots · clip-over-uncrossed · lane separation · lit-through-selected).
- [x] **Cells & colour desk overhaul (2026-07-30)** — cell face (emblem · digest · dots · compass tint · trigger glyph · white selection) · desk title-as-picker + popover · Colour NAMES · SPARSE palette · census protection. _(Placeholder SF-Symbol emblems still stand in for real artwork — the drawing job is a separate asset task, not a bug.)_
- [x] **Fresh-cell + naming + furniture (2026-07-30)** — fully-null new cells · full processor names · grid down-chevrons (watermark + column keys) · dual-side row rails · DELETE-sever→NULL.

## C. Buildable now (next increments)
- [ ] **MOSAIC §2 — THE CREST** (design ferry 2026-08-06, spec `AcceptanceCriteria-mosaic-face.md` §2; mosaic
  device-approved "looks amazing"). The largest rect gains 1–2 HASH-CHOSEN inscribed shapes (▲▽◆●, tone-on-tone,
  twins share) that light on the FIRST INSTANCE of the HIGHEST note per COLUMN ENTRY (peak brightness + timed fade)
  — two layers: rank breathes below, crown flashes above. Pure `mosaicCrest(hash:)` (testable) + a drawMosaic layer
  + a per-cell PEAK-NOTE feed (small engine plumbing, like the mosaic phase-2 per-note feed; v1 approximation
  available). PLAN drafted (see the spec §2 CODE NOTE + the chat).
- [ ] **THE WINDOW — the pre|post note graphic** (design ferry 2026-08-06, spec `AcceptanceCriteria-the-window-
  graphic.md`). ONE parameterized piano-roll component (NOW divider · held input bars left · derived-future rects
  scrolling in + firing at the line; brightness=velocity). LIVE (derive-ahead ~2 beats, pure) + CANNED modes; sizes
  S/M/L; sites = processor boxes · macro page MAIN/ALT · library · manual · receivers. §2 THE EYE = a header-bar
  inspect toggle → cell-tap opens the window popup. Needs a pure `scheduleAhead(...)` derive-ahead + the `NoteWindow`
  view. Larger feature; §3 LONG WINDOW / RACK VARIANT flagged futures.
- [x] **MACRO AUTHORING FLOW (canonical)** (Paul + design 2026-08-06, spec `AcceptanceCriteria-macro-authoring.md`;
  **LANDED 2026-08-06 — `MacroBindPopup` removed**) — a GENERIC control-group authoring page (MAIN/ALT instances →
  TEST slider+button → ADD-TO-MACRO assignment view), hosted by a control-group registry so processors · receivers ·
  emitters · rack all reuse it. Sparse relative deltas (the M1 offset model — already built); host-adaptive
  transactions (staged vs live); mover eligibility (discrete→buttons only); ALT persists per group; first-assign sets
  spring/toggle then locks it. KEPT the offset engine (M1) + AU params (M2) + MACROS tab (M3). **Residue still open:**
  the receiver / emitter / rack authoring domains (only the processor domain shipped) + the discrete-param binding
  path (only the 7 foldable continuous keys reach the engine). A future MACRO MAIN TAB (management surface) is
  separate + later.
- [x] **CONTROLLER ROUTING v1** (design ruling 2026-08-06, spec `AcceptanceCriteria-controller-routing.md`;
  **LANDED 2026-08-10 — `Receiver.controllerMask` exists**) — per-door cog mask CONTROLLERS→[A·B·C·D] (default
  all-live); forward matching CC/PB/AT/PC to each selected emitter RE-STAMPED to its channel; supersedes the
  hardwired `passthroughCableMask`. **CC123/120 = pool/latch FLUSH + forward** (all-notes-off must release us).
  **UMP legacy parity where cheap** (system/SysEx pass). BEND-ownership rule reserved for the future per-emitter
  bend stage. Model seam: `Receiver.controllerMask: UInt8?` (nil ⇒ 0b1111).
- [x] **MPE toggle + auto-detect RETIRED** (design ruling 2026-08-06, on `main`) — the RECEIVERS-tab MPE toggle
  (`ReceiverConfigView.mpeRow`) + the write-only auto-detect (`mpeSeenAt`) are gone (manual-honesty law: the UI
  stopped promising what nothing reads). `Receiver.mpeMerge` stays Codable + `setReceiverMpeMerge`/`mpeLikely`
  reserved for the two-lane expression era.
- [x] **THE "STRIPS DONE" WAVE** — emitter hold-while-sounding feed built + **device-verified 2026-07-30**
  (steady cargo-tinted `SoundMark` ticks + fade-on-release; `Router.snapshotEmitterSounding`; test
  `testEmitterSoundingReportsHeldNoteOnItsBusThenClearsOnRelease`). ④ polish-laws accepted at current values on
  the device pass. _(Latent: the release-fade keys on (vel, colour) not the wire note — same-vel chords could
  mis-pair a fade; not seen on device, revisit only if it surfaces.)_
- [x] **Full strip EDIT-face sweep** — DONE (off-device): the strips' EDIT faces were dead in the live path
  (nothing passed `editing:true`) and their config already lives on the cog (`CogPage.swift`). Retired
  `OutputsView.channelStepper` + `ReceiversView.editFeatures` and the `editing` param on both, plus the orphaned
  callbacks/helpers. Strips are single-face forever. _(Separate future: `GridView.editing` — the grid's own
  cell-editor mode — is untouched.)_ Device-verify: the strips look/behave unchanged (perform face only).
- [~] **CELL EDIT** (spec `Docs/AcceptanceCriteria/AcceptanceCriteria-cell-edit.md`; user-chosen phased build).
  **⚠ BANNER (2026-08-13): the PROCESSORS / cell-edit page was RETIRED — BUILD supersedes it; `editSpikePage` is now
  unreachable dead code.** So the whole block below is HISTORICAL: the crash bug is MOOT (the page can't be reached),
  and every open sub-item here needs TRIAGE — folded-into-BUILD, wanted-elsewhere, or dropped. Detail kept for the
  record; do not treat the `[ ]`/`[~]` marks below as live forward work until triaged.
  Decisions locked: start with the station skeleton; **triggers stay Colour-side** (no per-cell schema change).
  **LAYOUT (evolving): design-side revised B to a full-page takeover (2026-07-31); the USER then overrode that —
  the page REPLACES THE GRID in its slot (via `gridBlock`, like FLOW) while receivers/emitters/strips/desk/arr-bar
  stay visible + reachable. Spec B on file still says full-takeover — ferry the user's grid-slot override to
  design-side.** Content/model/engine/tests unaffected by all this layout churn.
  **~~OPEN BUG~~ MOOT (page RETIRED 2026-08-13, unreachable): crash on tapping the TRIGGERS section (device, first
  Cell-Edit device run). No logic error on that path (collapsed rows are plain text) → suspected a SwiftUI
  transition/nesting crash; the grid-slot move may have cleared it. No longer reachable, so no retest needed.**
  - [x] **Phase 1 — station skeleton + full-page rework** (off-device): EDIT = a 6th TOGGLE (out of the `Verb`
    enum); tap re-points + suppresses the trigger fire. **Re-architected to the full-page takeover**: `cellEditPage`
    replaces the whole grid layout when a cell is pointed; pinned breadcrumb (scene · column · 8-dot minimap ·
    DONE); persistent LOOP+TEST strip (placeholders; test pad shows the glyph, H6); ONE vertical accordion
    (IDENTITY · INPUT · TRIGGERS · OUTPUT · sound-desk, B4). Retired the `primarySlot`/`deskSwapBar`/`deskShowsColour`
    in-place swap. Device-verify: takeover push/return (DONE + re-tap EDIT), breadcrumb minimap, one-open accordion.
  - [x] **Phase 2a — triggers accordion** (Colour-side, off-device): a one-open accordion editing `Colour.on`
    via `editOn`→`editBrushColour` (undoable); reused `OnConfig` wholesale — no schema change. **Curated to the
    WIRED actions only** (user, this version): TAP none/alt/mute/solo · HOLD none/alt/oct · ARRIVE none/alt-
    alternate/morph-drift/emitter-rotate; the inert placeholders (fill/replay/freeze/slice-cycle/morph-scrub/dice)
    + the LEAVE & SCENE rows are hidden (enum cases kept for a future TOUCH-box design pass). Device-verify:
    pickers offer only the wired actions, each fires in perform, edits ride to the cell-face glyph.
  - [ ] **Phase 2b — REDIRECT + retrigger style** (NET-NEW model+engine): the REDIRECT TAP/HOLD action + ALT-DEST
    A–D toggles (new `OnConfig` field + admission-time engine effect); the TAP CUT|LAYER retrigger field.
  - [~] **Utilities §I**: [x] Apply-input-to-scope (twins / all-colour, reuse `applyToScope` + live counts) +
    Reset-input (off-device). [ ] Copy/Paste CONFIG (a cell input+triggers clipboard, `ProcClip` pattern) — deferred.
  - [x] **Phase 3 — input editing** (COMPLETE, off-device): source · octave/transpose · chord-split · velocity window.
    - [x] **3a source picker** (off-device): NONE · MIDI-IN R1–R4 · FROM ROW n value-chip, editing the existing
      `inputRow`/`inputReceiver` (reuse `routeInReceiver`/`routeInRow`/`routeInSourcesAbove`). No schema change.
    - [x] **3b chord-split** (NET-NEW, off-device): ALL · TOP n · BOTTOM n · KEY RANGE. `Cell.chordSplit?`
      (migration-safe) → `SnapCell`; pure `chordSplitWindow` applied inside the `srcCount(for:)`/`srcAscending(for:)`
      readers (contiguous window, ALL fast-path); station INPUT SPLIT control (per-cell). Tests: window (all
      modes+edges) · readers apply it · Codable/migration. _(Follow-up: preview/audition STRUM use a raw filter,
      so the split doesn't reach those two paths yet.)_
    - [x] **3c velocity window** (NET-NEW, off-device): `Cell.velWindow?` (migration-safe) → `SnapCell`;
      velocity-aware base readers composed as velocity-admit THEN chord-split (full-range fast-path); station
      VEL ≥ / VEL ≤ steppers. Tests: gating + composition + Codable/migration.
    - [x] **3d input octave + transpose** (off-device, REUSE not net-new): per spec "existing steppers,
      unchanged" — surfaces the per-Colour `transpose` (−24…+24 st, already engine-wide) as a SHIFT row (octave
      ±12 + semitone ±1) via `setBrushTranspose`. Colour-side like triggers; no schema/engine change. _(If a true
      per-CELL input transpose is wanted later, that's the net-new ~5-site version — deferred.)_
  - [~] **Phase 4 — output/chop** (spec F REVISED 2026-07-31):
    - [x] **UI + model** (off-device): MAIN dest A–D (LIVE, edits cell.buses) · the 8×2 chop grid (MAIN+redirect
      dot / MUTE) · shared ALT A–D. New `Cell.chop` (Chop = 8 slots + alt set, migration-safe; Codable test).
      Grid/alt edits persist but are labelled "routing engine pending".
    - [~] **chop routing ENGINE** (SEMANTIC confirmed by user: 8 slices divide the CELL'S OWN column, a per-cell
      output gate — not pass columns):
      - [x] **TICK cells** (off-device): `chopSlice(mBeat, columnBeats:)` → each ARP tick / RATCHET repeat routes
        MAIN/ALT/MUTE by its slice within the column (`chopBusMask`); MUTE-slice = silent. Tests cover both pure
        fns. (Reverted the earlier wrong pass-column indexing.)
      - [ ] **HOLD cells** (identity/passgate/chance/harmonize) — the trance-GATE: sub-articulate the sustained
        chord into 8 slices (note-off at MUTE edges, ALT redirect), interacting with legato/harmonize/adoption.
        The bigger piece.
      - [ ] **STRUM + row-fed MIRROR** chop (thread the onset slice in).
    - Open call F (emitter-picker vs spatial ROUTE-OUT) — both surfaced now (two doors); leave as-is unless the
      user rules to collapse them.
  - [ ] **Phase 5 — LOOP**: single-column loop ≈ one-bit `laneMask` via existing `lapColumn` (very low engine
    risk); UI toggle + wiring. Resolve open call G3 (LOOP-starts-playback-when-stopped).
  - [ ] **Phase 6 — test pad**: real-path stopped-time trigger fire (self-driven clock + silence-invariant
    exemption + scope). Hardest engine piece.
- [x] **Trigger-glyph cell face** (§3) — built in the cells-and-colour-desk overhaul (emblem · trigger glyph · digest · dots · compass tint) and device-verified 2026-07-30.
- [x] **Touch completions** — palette LIVE during holds · **STROKES** · **MIXED-SET law** — ALL DONE (2026-07-29; see the DONE block above).
- [ ] **Live preset previews** · **SCROLL+TEACH** (both deferred-flagged).
- [ ] **Tag `v0.7-gui`** (user tags manually).
- [ ] **CAPTURED via ferry 2026-08-07 (specs of record, NOT built — design-side Claude, Paul's asks):**
  - [x] **GLIDE processor** (`AcceptanceCriteria-glide-processor.md`; **LANDED 2026-08-10 — `ProcessorType.glide` +
    `GlidePriority` exist**) — notes→pitchbend: first note = anchor, each next = a bend ramp (mono sliding voice);
    RANGE handshake; out-of-range RE-ANCHOR (steps glide, leaps articulate) or CLAMP; params TIME/RANGE/PRIORITY.
    Shares BEND's expression scheduler + channel-ownership plumbing.
  - [ ] **WEAVE driver** (`AcceptanceCriteria-weave-driver.md`) — a rank-clocked polyrhythm DRIVER (arp/rtc/strum
    family; last-driver rule): each pool member ticks on its own rank-derived clock. MODE = LADDER / HARMONIC★ /
    DRAWN; params BASE/GATE/SPAN. Two chips: TAPE (rate×2 → +12) · DUR-BY-INTERVAL (leap → length). Pure per-rank.
  - [ ] **EDIT-TIME DERIVATION SERVICES** (`AcceptanceCriteria-edit-time-derivation.md`) — one facility
    `deriveInput(toSlot:against:span:)` (the dice's audition machinery, exposed offline) → four services: FITTED
    DEFAULTS (a newborn stage seeds from its input) · PICKER PREVIEWS (choose a type by result) · DEGENERACY
    WARNINGS (flag near-silence/wrap before commit) · ADAPTIVE RANGES + derived slot summaries.

## D. Parked futures — log only, NO build (re-explain from `design-ferry-completions-phase-cc-2026-07-28.md`)
- [ ] FEEDBACK EDGES (unit-delay) · THE PIN · MASTER+TEXTURE multi-playhead · **THE CC RAIL** · **THE TWO-LANE INSTRUMENT** (+ cross-lane valves) · MORPH desk (16 faders) · EXTERNAL processor type + standalone-app milestone.
- [ ] **MULTI-INPUT / fan-in — THE G1 RULING** (design-Claude, 2026-07-30; captured here because the ferry note is
  transient). Shipping subset = **multi-RECEIVER-in** only (merge the four doors); keep the single row-parent so
  chains stay trees (no DAG, cycles impossible). At a union point: the pool is a **refcounted SET** (a note lives
  while ANY source holds it; entry dies at count 0; dedup by wire note-number after per-source transforms).
  **Velocity** = the latest strike UPDATES the pool entry but NEVER re-strikes a sounding hold-voice (applies to
  the next articulation). **Voice identity stays source-blind**: note + emitter + Colour-and-face, refcounted at
  the union. Full multi-row-parent remains the parked birthstone (schema-as-set already insures it).

## E. Architecture debt (opportunistic, all accepted)
- [ ] §6a CLAIM L3 residual (short-note All `on,off,on,off`) · `TODO(spec §7)` param route (writes doc then rebuilds) · `Cell.stack`/`srcMix` kept load-bearing for the v2→v3 migration.
- [ ] **HARMONIZER hung-note ROOT CAUSE** (user-reported device bug, 2026-07-31) — the §a8b playing-time net now
  auto-clears it within ~1 s (safety net, committed), but the underlying leak is NOT fixed. HARMONIZE emits
  root + up to 3 interval voices per source note with column-boundary offs (Router `emitHarmony`); a missed/late
  off leaves a stuck wire note. Suspect the close-vs-reemit ordering at a column boundary or a refcount imbalance
  amplified by harmonize's fan-out (4× voices vs identity's 1×). Repro on device, then trace `emitHarmony` →
  `emitArtic`/`openVoice` refcount across a column transition + a live interval change while a chord sustains.

## F. Codebase-review carry-over (§12, 2026-08-16)
The currently-open medium/large work captured in `Docs/codebase-review-2026-08-16.md §12` (and CLAUDE.md status) that
this file otherwise omits — one line each, see the review for detail:
- [ ] **BuildModel / ColourRegistry extraction + BUILD selection unification** — pull BUILD's model out of the view.
- [ ] **Colour-owned routing** (the "four steers ①") — lift buses/receiver/chop off `Cell` onto `Colour`.
- [ ] **Split `Router.process`** — the ~35-arg monolith.
- [ ] **Persisted-DTO / working-model split** — separate the on-disk document from the live working model.
- [ ] **Total macro model** — discrete-delta bake (bug M1: discrete-param macros don't fold yet).
- [ ] **RACK engine tests** — fence / mono / pocket / conversation / curve are untested.
- [ ] **Unassigned-BUILD-part persistence follow-ups** — the deployed play-grid isn't persisted yet, and "exactly
  one unassigned part" isn't a hard invariant.
